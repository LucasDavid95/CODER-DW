Previously a child soldier under Solidus Snake, Raiden was later selected by the Patriots to test the S3 Plan at the Big Shell, as a new recruit to the reformed FOXHOUND unit.

After successfully escaping, Raiden went on to assist Solid Snake during the Guns of the Patriots Incident.

His name was derived from the wind condition that occurs in Southern California. Donning a specialized custom cyborg body, the immense Sundowner wielded two high-frequency machetes known as "Bloodlust." In addition, the two machetes could also be merged into a scissors-like contraption to cause further damage to the enemy. His cyborg serial number was 978-AZQEE.

Mistral was one of the Winds of Destruction, alongside Sundowner and Monsoon. Her code-name is derived from the dry northern winds that blow from the Alps to the Mediterranean. Mistral used multiple copies of her main weapon called "L'Ã‰tranger" (French for "Stranger") in whip and rod configurations and could easily rebuild a new one at ease. Outside of combat operations, she wore a black and violet coat with pauldrons, which she removed in a suggestive manner before engaging her opponent. Mistral's serial number was 977-AZQEE.

He was one of the Winds of Destruction alongside Sundowner and Mistral, and was named after the seasonal wind systems that occur in West Africa and Asia-Australia. Monsoon was capable of magnetically dislocating his entire body to attack from a distance, and wielded Sai weapons called "Dystopia", which were enhanced via magnetic fields. He also seemed to believe that the point of humans was to fight, be consumed with greed and kill, which was based on his childhood in Cambodia. His serial number was 976-AZQEE. He was fluent in Khmer, Chinese, and English. Unlike the other Winds of Destruction, he wasn't a former member of any military or paramilitary organizations prior to enlisting with the group. Instead, he was a former gang member.
